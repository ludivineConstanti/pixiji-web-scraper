# 💽 Pixiji Web Scraper

This project was created to gather data from the [jisho website](https://jisho.org/) to use in one of my personal projects. It uses a dataset that I created manually, for the [1st version of the Pixiji website](https://github.com/ludivineConstanti/Pixiji), and adds more informations that I needed for a new feature that is implemented in the [2nd version of the website](https://github.com/ludivineConstanti/pixiji-gatsby).

The ⚡⚡⚡ [mdDocumentation folder](https://github.com/ludivineConstanti/pixiji-web-scraper/tree/main/mdDocumentation) ⚡⚡⚡ contains some observations made during the project (bugs, research...).
